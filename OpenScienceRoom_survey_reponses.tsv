"What can we learn from industry?" might be more of a Student & Postdoc SIG topic. OSR was a success last year, partly because it had a very well defined scope -- keep it that way. "Open" doesn't mean talk about everything.

I think "diversity & inclusivity" and "what can we learn from industry" are not Open Science SIG topics, and it wouldn't make sense to include them. I liked the open science room last year: lots of demos and presentations of tools and methods.

Even for an unconference-style meeting, it would be nice to schedule times so that event start times match the main conference. It was very frustrating when I saw an OSR talk/discussion that straddled two main conference sessions and I had to decide when an OSR event was worth missing two OHBM events from the main schedule. Also, for OSR events that can be planned farther in advance (even if the precise speakers or topics are unknown) it would be nice to better coordinate events to not conflict with similarly themed talks/sessions in the main conference.

Cluster failure 1 & 2 (Eklund, 2016, 2018) and Characterizing Variability (Bowring, 2018) are asking very important questions, that it'd be great to dedicate some time for.	I think staying away from things that aren't within the SIG mandate - diversity or industry discussions - and that avoid making us look too combative - debates - are a better path forward, personally.

I also got distracted by group meetings in the room during 'scheduled' presentations.

New acquisition methods or cutting-edge few/single-subject studies are not easily standardized, are we running a risk that things can be dismissed as non-open science, just because they don't fit into what the majority of researchers do? I have seen comments like "Matlab is bad" or "PhD student, don't even try to do a 20-subjects-study in the age of big data!" by leading voices in the field - could this harm research diversity?
